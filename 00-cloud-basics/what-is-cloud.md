# What is Cloud Computing?

## Simple Explanation
Cloud computing means using computing resources such as servers, storage, and databases over the internet instead of owning and managing physical machines.

## Why Cloud Computing Exists
Before cloud, companies had to:
- Buy physical servers
- Maintain data centers
- Handle power, cooling, and hardware failures

Cloud computing removes this responsibility and allows teams to focus on building applications.

## Real-World Example
Instead of purchasing a server to host a website, a company can launch a virtual server on the cloud within minutes and pay only for the resources they use.

## Key Benefits
- On-demand resource availability
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Scalability based on demand
- High availability and reliability

## My Understanding
Cloud computing is not just a cost-saving solution. It enables faster innovation, easier scaling, and better reliability for modern applications.

## What I Learned
Understanding cloud fundamentals is critical before learning AWS services, otherwise cloud concepts feel confusing and disconnected.
