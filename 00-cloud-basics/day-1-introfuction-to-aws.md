# Day 1 – Introduction to AWS & Public Cloud

This file documents what I learned on Day 1 while starting my AWS cloud journey.  
The focus is on understanding cloud basics and why AWS is widely used.



## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means using computing resources such as servers, storage, and databases over the internet instead of owning and managing physical machines.

Users can access these resources whenever needed and pay only for what they use.



## What is Public Cloud?

Public cloud is a cloud model where the infrastructure is owned and managed by a cloud provider and shared among multiple users.

Anyone can create an account, use services, and access resources over the internet in a secure way.



## Public Cloud vs Private Cloud

### Public Cloud
- Infrastructure managed by cloud provider
- Shared resources
- Pay-as-you-go pricing
- Highly scalable

### Private Cloud
- Used by a single organization
- More control over infrastructure
- Higher setup and maintenance cost
- Limited scalability



## Why is Public Cloud So Popular?

Public cloud is popular because:
- No need to buy physical servers
- Easy to scale resources up or down
- Lower initial investment
- Faster deployment of applications



## Why AWS?

AWS is widely used because:
- It offers a large number of cloud services
- It has data centers across the world
- It provides flexible pricing
- It is trusted by startups and enterprises



## Are Companies Moving Back to Private Cloud?

Some companies move specific workloads back to private environments due to cost or compliance reasons.

However, most organizations use a **hybrid cloud approach**, combining public and private cloud.



## What I Learned on Day 1

- Cloud computing removes the need for physical infrastructure
- Public cloud enables flexibility and scalability
- AWS is a leading cloud provider
- Strong fundamentals are important before learning advanced AWS services
