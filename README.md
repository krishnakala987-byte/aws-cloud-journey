# AWS Cloud Journey 

This repository captures my personal journey of learning Amazon Web Services (AWS) from the ground up, with a strong focus on understanding concepts deeply and applying them through hands-on practice.

Instead of just collecting notes, this repository reflects how I think, practice, make mistakes, and improve as a cloud learner.



## Why I Built This Repository

I created this repository to:
- Build strong cloud fundamentals with clarity
- Practice AWS services through real console-based labs
- Understand *why* services exist, not just *how* to use them
- Track my progress publicly and stay disciplined
- Create a genuine cloud portfolio that reflects real learning



## How I Learn Cloud

My learning approach is simple but strict:
1. Learn the concept in plain language
2. Relate it to real-world scenarios
3. Implement it practically on AWS
4. Face errors and misconfigurations
5. Fix them and document the lessons

This helps me think like a cloud engineer, not just a student.



## Topics Being Covered

- Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Introduction to AWS & Global Infrastructure
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- EC2 and Compute Concepts
- AWS Networking (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, NACLs)
- More services will be added as I progress



##  What Makes This Repository Different

Each topic includes:
- Clear explanation in my own words
- Practical implementation steps
- Common beginner mistakes
- Key takeaways from hands-on experience



##  Current Status

This repository is actively updated as I continue learning and strengthening my cloud engineering skills.
