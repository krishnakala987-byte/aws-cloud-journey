# AWS IAM – Basics

## Why I wrote this
IAM is the foundation of AWS security. If I understand IAM well, all other services become easier to manage securely.

## Core idea in 5 lines
- IAM controls access to AWS
- It answers who you are and what you can do
- Everything is denied by default
- Permissions are added using policies
- Root user is not for daily use

## How AWS actually works here
- IAM is a global service
- It manages identities and permissions
- Policies are evaluated every time a request is made

## When I should use this
- Creating users for team members
- Giving services access to other services
- Restricting actions on AWS resources

## Common mistakes I must avoid
- Using root user
- Giving admin access unnecessarily
- Sharing credentials


## one point to keep in mind
 -Least privilege is key
